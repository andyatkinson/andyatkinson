### Hello 👋

I specialize in building high performance web applications using PostgreSQL and Ruby on Rails.

I'm the author of **High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails** <https://pragprog.com/titles/aapsql>, published by Pragmatic Programmers in 2024.

I care about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. I support [#BlackLivesMatter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackLivesMatter) ✊🏿 and [#StandWithUkraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/StandWithUkraine).🇺🇦
